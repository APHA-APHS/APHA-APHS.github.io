<h2>Here's the Posts</h2>

<h4>POST NUMBER 1</h4>
```{r warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
post <- read.table("Posts/sample.txt", 
                 header = FALSE, sep="~")

#Right now this generates a single blog post.
#But I need to be able to generate lots of blog posts!
#So here is my plan:
#Get a list of all the .txt files in the directory
#Arrange them by some kind of title-naming-convention
#Create a new dataframe for each one
#Figure out a paragraph separating character (probably ~)
#Figure out how to render however many of these newly created dataframes there are in the body of markdown
#Figure out how to give each one a nice title
```

`r post`

<p>And that's all for now.</p>
