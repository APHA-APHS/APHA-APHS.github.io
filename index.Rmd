<h2>A section of the American Public Health Association</h2>

<p>The Applied Public Health Statistics Section of APHA,
organized in 1908, provides a focus for people involved and/or interested in
public health statistics. It serves as the APHA focal point that identifies
issues, develops strategies and promotes activities in the area of statistics.
The Section also provides a common forum to exchange experiences and knowledge
in statistics, which contributes to the activities of APHA and shares in the
general responsibilities of the public health movement.</p>

<p>Brian, you still need to do the following things:</p>
* Add in one of the images
* Maybe add some more explanatory text about what this site is
* And then add a link to some other pages that might be important. 
* And probably make the font neat
* And then figure out how to put all the documents in the main directory.
